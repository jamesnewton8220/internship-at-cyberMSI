After completing my B.E. in Cybersecurity Engineering, I decided to gain real-world exposure to how Security Operations Centers (SOCs) function. I started identifying companies that provide hands-on SOC training or internships related to SIEM, log monitoring, and threat detection.

📨 2. Applying for the Internship
I found CyberMSI through research and LinkedIn. Their focus on Microsoft Sentinel and real-time threat detection matched my learning goals.
🔹 I tailored my resume
